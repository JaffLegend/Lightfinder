# Lightfinder
A simple, offline and extremely lightweight information finder.
Right now Lightfinder is in one of its earliest releases, you could download Lightfinder right now and it will work just fine.

## Notes 
v2.0 is coming! This release will come with a new number of features:
 * Auto update detection
 * More words than ever
 * **Search feature**, if word is not found
 v2.0 may be released in the next weeks or maybe even months, we will pin the date if it is definite. 

## How to Use
1. Download the installer from the [Lightfinder website](https://bit.ly/lightfinder).
2. Run the installer to install to DESKTOP.
3. Look in the DESKTOP folder to launch Lightfinder.
4. And launch the EXE!

## How to Update
For minor updates, use the UPDATE.bat or launch the Lightfinder.py, (New feature: Lightfinder now asks you to update!) and say 'yes' or 'y' to update, but this is only for minor updates, for major updates, go to our website and download our installer to update.

## Specifications 
Right now PythonPedia is best supported for Windows, as we have created a package for it, it will work OK on Linux and MacOS, but it would remove some features, such as updating easily, running from directly the installer, and not downloading extra programs (which in our case, is Python). If there are other developers who know how to compile python to Linux or MacOS executables please notify us as soon as possible.
