# Lightfinder
A simple, offline and extremely lightweight information finder.
Right now Lightfinder is in one of its earliest releases, you could download Lightfinder right now and it will work just fine.

## How to Use
1. Download the installer from the [Lightfinder website](https://bit.ly/lightfinder).
2. Run the installer to install to DESKTOP.
3. Look in the DESKTOP folder to launch Lightfinder.
4. And launch the EXE!

## How to Update
To update the words, on Windows (only supported OS) click on the UPDATE.bat file and follow the prompts. Please note that this file will ONLY update the words, not the entire Lightfinder. Instead you will have to come to our offficial website and download it again.

### Specifications 
Right now PythonPedia is best supported for Winndows, as we have created a package for it, it will work OK on Linuuz and MacOS, but it would remove some features, such as updating easily, running from directly the installer, and not downloading extra programs (which in our case, is Python).
