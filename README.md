# Lightfinder
A simple, offline and extremely lightweight information finder. Created by your favourie organisation, LightOrg.

## Notes 
v2.0 is coming! This release will come with a new number of features:
 * Auto update detection
 * More words than ever
 * **Search feature**, if word is not found. <br/>
 v2.0 may be released in the next weeks or maybe even months, we will pin the date, if it is definite. 

## Next Release 
The next release is v1.2! This release is coming in the next week or so, and it has some exciting new features:
* Lightfinder now asks to update!
* UPDATE.bat now has a easy-to-use GUI!
Look out for this update!
## How to Use
1. Download the installer from the [Lightfinder website](https://bit.ly/lightfinder).
2. Run the installer to install to DESKTOP.
3. Look in the DESKTOP folder to launch Lightfinder.
4. And launch the EXE!

## How to Update
For minor updates, use the UPDATE.bat or launch the Lightfinder.py, (New feature: Lightfinder now asks you to update!) and say 'yes' or 'y' to update, but this is only for minor updates, for major updates, go to our website and download our installer to update.

## Specifications 
Right now PythonPedia is best supported for Windows, as we have created a package for it, it will work OK on Linux and MacOS, but it would remove some features, such as updating easily, running from directly the installer, and not downloading extra programs (which in our case, is Python). If there are other developers who know how to compile python to Linux or MacOS executables please notify us as soon as possible.

## Contribution
If you want to contribute to this project, by submitting a new word, please [fill in this form](https://form.jotform.com/212341044897052) or if you want to contribute to the code please do so, if you have some knowledge of Python or Batchfile. Please push onto this branch and not 'dist' as we will review it before it is released for distrubution.

## Distrubution 
There is a 'dist' branch, which there (For v2.0 and newer) will be the stable version for distrubution, which mean that 'main' can now also be used for unstable code, before this, there used to be unstable code and which UPDATE.bat will update to, then the people who use Lightfinder, will now have a unstable (even broken) code source. The 'dist' branch fixes this.
