# Lightfinder
A simple, offline and extremely lightweight information finder. Created by your favourie organisation, LightOrg. Type a word, see the meaning!

## Notes 
### v2.0 is coming soon!
**v2.0** is coming! This release will come with a new number of features:
 * Auto update detection
 * More words than ever
 * **Search feature**, if word is not found. <br/>

 v2.0 may be released in the next weeks or maybe even months, we will pin the date, if it is definite. 

## Next Release 
Our next release is v1.4! This release will make a proper Update app which updates anything, even major updates! 
## How to Use (For v1.3 and newer)
1. Download the installer from the [Lightfinder website](https://bit.ly/lightfinder).
2. Run the installer to install.
3. Look in the Start Menu. 
4. Run Lightfinder.
5. Now use your Lightfinder!

## How to Update
**For v1.4 onwards,** Use the Update  app to update to the latest version, and use Refresh.bat to update your word list.
For v1.0 to v1.4, use the UPDATE.bat or launch the Lightfinder.py, (New feature: Lightfinder now asks you to update!) and say 'yes' or 'y' to update, but this is only for minor updates, for major updates, go to our website and download our installer to update.


## Specifications 
Right now PythonPedia is best supported for Windows, as we have created a package for it, it will work OK on Linux and MacOS, but it would remove some features, such as updating easily, running from directly the installer, and not downloading extra programs (which in our case, is Python). If there are other developers who know how to compile python to Linux or MacOS executables please notify us as soon as possible.

## Contribution
If you want to contribute to this project, by submitting a new word, please [fill in this form](https://form.jotform.com/212341044897052) or if you want to contribute to the code please do so, if you have some knowledge of Python or Batchfile. Please push onto this branch and not 'dist' as we will review it before it is released for distrubution.

## Distribution 
There is a 'dist' branch, which there (For v1.2 and newer) will be the stable version for distribution, which mean that 'main' can now also be used for unstable code, before this, there used to be unstable code and which UPDATE.bat will update to, then the people who use Lightfinder, will now have a unstable (even broken) code source. The 'dist' branch fixes this.
